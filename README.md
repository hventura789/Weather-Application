# Weather-Application-API-2022
This is a java project which includes an API that allows a beginner programmer to easily create a weather application with a GUI using Java and JavaFX. 

This API is called World Weather Finder API. The purpose of this API is to help the end user to more easily create a weather app that can get weather data from any major city in the world from the internet (using another API) and display weather data via a GUI. This application relies on the Open Weather Map API that can be found at: https://openweathermap.org/api -- This is where we will get the current weather data for our application. 

**Note:  When you are testing your program, make sure to enter the city in the format of either... "City Name" alone OR "City Name, Country Shorthand" e.g. Pittsburgh, US; or London, UK; or just Seattle**

**Also NOTE: You will need to either clone the repository for the gson API (can be found on github), or download the jar files for gson 2.8.2 in order to make this app functional and to effectively connect to the OpenWeatherMap.org API. The gson API allows us to convert the json code into a Java Map<String, Object> in order to get the weather data from the OpenWeatherMap.org API and to be able to use it in our Java weather application!**
