# Weather-Application
This is a java project which includes an API that allows a beginner programmer to easily create a weather application with a GUI using Java and JavaFX. 

This API is called World Weather Finder API. The purpose of this API is to help the end user to more easily create a weather app that can get weather data from any major city in the world from the internet (using another API) and display weather data via a GUI. 

Note:  When you are testing your program, make sure to enter the city in the format of either... "City Name" alone OR "City Name, Country Shorthand" e.g. Pittsburgh, US; or London, UK; or just Seattle
